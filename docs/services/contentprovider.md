Researchers use a dense network of research data. The small subjects are dependent on research data from a wide range of disciplinary sources. NFDI4SD provides software packages for computational notebooks that can import, cite and reuse the diverse data offered by providers. The employed research data are used in data links, algorithmic derivation or combined data sets. Linked data is an essential part of the research work. In their combination, the NFDI4SD provides invaluable support for automated access to required research data.

- Data aggregation: Research objects of one species are often required on a large scale, often as representative sample data: Documents on a topic are rarely found already prepared and compiled in one data source. Even very large libraries and archives seldom maintain complete collections. Most research projects depend on their own consolidation of the research subjects and preparation of the data in suitable data formats.
