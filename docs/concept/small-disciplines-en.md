**Why do "small disciplines" need an NFDI?**

The progressing digitalization and the Open Access movement have led to a transformation
of the research process and resulted in a broader dissemination of research data. In the course of this development, academic institutions such as universities, research institutes, but also smaller groups and agents have committed themselves to the sustainable management and interdisciplinary exchange of research data. The initiative to establish a National Research Data Infrastructure reflects this massive structural change. This involves the systematic planning, collection, processing, analysis, archiving, publication and exchange of data of various types for reuse by the scientific community and a broader interested public.

The Humanities, Cultural Studies and Social Sciences in particular have been and continue to be faced with new challenges in this regard, since research data management and standardized data exchange are often less naturally integrated into their disciplinary culture and infrastructure than in the case of the Life Sciences or Natural Sciences.

The challenges associated with these tasks are particularly difficult to master in the so-called small disciplines. These currently include over 150 disciplines throughout Germany, predominantly
Humanities, Social and Cultural Sciences, which, institutionally and in terms of self-understanding, are not mere sub-disciplines of a larger discipline.

The long-term funding and guarantee of the long-term sustainability of these disciplines is a high-ranking objective of German education and research infrastructure as a whole, as Federal Minister of Education and Research Anja Karliczek emphasized: "The small disciplines provide valuable answers to the many major questions facing our society, not least of all what holds it together. They create significant knowledge and contribute to the preservation of our cultural heritage".

At the same time, small disciplines do not have access to the resources of the institutions to which they are usually organizationally linked, or cannot access them to the extent necessary when setting up modern research data infrastructures. However, they also do not posses the necessary resources and structures of their own to support the specific needs of their academic community with regard to modern research data management, to adapt existing practices to new standards, and thus to implement compatible, user-oriented concepts for data exchange, backup and reuse. 

As the "Arbeitsstelle Kleiner Fächer" supported by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research emphasizes, although the majority of small subjects belong to the Humanities and Cultural Studies, which are "altogether less externally funded", they have a comparatively above-average proportion of third-party funding (unlike major subjects in the Humanities and Cultural Studies). This is the case both in terms of the number of applications and the approved funds–which can be seen not least as an indicator of a correspondingly high demand.

[^3]: Hoffmann, Stefanie; Haas, Katharina; Bahlmann, Katharina; Schmidt, Uwe: 2019: Report on the status of mapping small disciplines in the project "Exchange of experience, networking and promotion of visibility of small disciplines", esp. pp. 18-23..

 At present, there is no standardized higher education policy framework for the promotion of small subjects in Germany: In some states, special programs have been initiated, in others there are no measures at all; these are supplemented by funding offers from the respective professional associations or foundations. 

[^4]: See the detailed information provided by the Arbeitsstelle Kleine Fächer, JGU Mainz, 2020: https://www.kleinefaecher.de/rahmenbedingungen.html, (accessed on 30.08.2020).

A further factor to be considered here is the particularly collaborative and transdisciplinary approach to small subjects, as is also being investigated in a BMBF-funded research project on the "Dynamics of small subjects" from 2019 to 2022. 

[^5]: See the current information from the Arbeitsstelle Kleine Fächer, https://www.kleinefaecher.de/kartierung/arbeitsstelle-kleine-faecher.html

This not only concerns collaborations between several small and/or medium-sized subjects, but also the teaching and supervision of young researchers. Given the breadth of topics and variety of methods, research questions and topics in small subjects can often only be characterized and adequately addressed through the participation of several disciplines: Innovations are typically achieved through cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural work in transnational exchange and therefore particularly require digital networking, the exchange of research data and a powerful and user-friendly infrastructure in order to realize this goal and expand it for the future.

**Small disciplines: formal criteria**

In order to differentiate small subjects from larger departments and sub-disciplines, the "Small Subjects Unit" at JGU Mainz has developed criteria,

[^6]: These criteria serve as a working basis and definition of the Arbeitsstelle Kleine Fächer, please see https://www.kleinefaecher.de/kartierung/was-ist-ein-kleines-fach.html.

 which will be used and expanded in the following as a basis for determining characteristics, user profiles and specific requirements for the use of research data. At present, the center assumes 157 small subjects and 2311 professorships at 89 locations nationwide. These belong to six disciplinary cultures, which in turn are divided into 19 sections: 1) Humanities; 2) Health Sciences; 3) Engineering and Technology; 4) Arts and Humanities; 5) Natural Sciences, Agricultural Sciences and Geography; 6) Law, Economics and Social Sciences.

[^7]: See Hoffmann, Stefanie; Haas, Katharina; Bahlmann, Katharina; Schmidt, Uwe 2019: Report on the status of mapping small disciplines in the project "Exchange of experience, networking and promotion of the visibility of small disciplines", esp. p. 9f.

More than half of the small disciplines belong to the Humanities, followed at some distance by the disciplines summarized under 5) and those summarized under 6). 

[^8]: See Hoffmann, Stefanie; Haas, Katharina; Bahlmann, Katharina; Schmidt, Uwe 2019: Report on the status of mapping small disciplines in the project "Exchange of experience, networking and promotion of visibility of small disciplines", esp. p. 18.

 A decisive factor in this context is that the specific interests of many of the disciplines grouped together in the disciplinary cultures have so far not been addressed separately, if at all, which is due not least to a relatively pronounced dynamic in the field: New small disciplines such as Digital Humanities or Biodiversity are establishing themselves, while others are losing their status as "small" disciplines due to strong growth or are being absorbed into larger disciplines.

- The formal requirements for belonging to the small disciplines are the number of no more than three permanent professorships per location; up to two exceptions are possible throughout Germany. The respective discipline has its own professorships with specific denominations.

- Separate study programs with qualified degrees: The respective academic discipline is represented at German universities with its own study programs (Bachelor's/Master's/Magister's/ Diplom/ Staatsexamen).

- The selection and training of young academics, i.e., the possibility of obtaining a doctorate as well as the establishment of junior professorships with the prospect of permanent or tenure-track positions.

  

**Social and communicative criteria**

Small disciplines no longer cooperate and communicate only on a project-oriented basis, but generally have an international and collaborative focus in order to meet the specific research requirements that are thematically and structurally determined. At the same time, they also have a distinct communication structure and suitable forms of media as well as a mindset that is recognizable to the public.

- This includes the self-conception as a subject in its own right: The professors who represent the respective branch of academic study at German universities see it as an independent subject.

- Representation by a learned society: The respective branch of knowledge is represented by a national or international learned society or, in exceptional cases, is clearly recognized as an independent subject by a superordinate society. This is not least a requirement for access to funding from various institutions, which small disciplines are particularly dependent on.

- Professional journals and other communication organs: The respective academic discipline has its own national or international pertinent publication organs.

  

**Target groups and their requirements**

It is the declared goal of the NFDI4SD to provide an infrastructure and services for all small disciplines and the academic cultures and groups represented by them and to support them in the implementation of their individual goals and projects in terms of sustainable research data management. A service structure that can be assembled modularly according to the respective needs and requirements will help in this process. The different professional, communication and publication cultures of scholars and scientists (in the following referred to as users, agents or researchers) must be taken into account and should not be restricted by static, inflexible conditions and processes. The sociologist Rudolf Stichweh described academic disciplines in the context of differentiation and de-differentiation movements in 2019 as highly dynamic communication systems: The increasing problem orientation and project planning of modern research is thus further intensified by digitization, but also by new demands on professional qualifications. 

[^9]: See Szöllösi-Brenig, Vera: Report on the symposium "Disciplines in motion - Differentiation and de-differentiation in the academic system?", 2019, p. 2, https://www.volkswagenstiftung.de/sites/default/files/downloads/2019-05%20Bericht_Fächer-in-Bewegung.pdf, (accessed on 30.08.2020).

The NFDI4SD consortium will therefore deliberately incorporate researchers from various disciplines and interested institutions into the development process of the new infrastructure, including the use of social media, the development, dissemination and evaluation of questionnaires on the desired service offering, and the tendering and funding of pilot projects. The knowledge and experience gained will be incorporated into the establishment and development process of the NFDI4SD and will be evaluated successively. The aim is to offer and implement the reusability of research data by means of various strategies for handling them, as otherwise these data will be lost to the general public due to a lack of resources–whether time, know-how or financial means.

At this point, another characteristic of the NFDI4SD becomes clear: projects at different stages of development, of varying sizes and with varying funding periods are explicitly addressed, from qualification projects such as theses and dissertations to larger research groups in institutions or universities.

Especially in the case of doctoral theses, in many disciplines the final publication of research results has so far been the primary indicator of the success of a research project, while underlying data are not contextualized and systematically indexed. Thus, the latter cannot be cited by others or would have to be reworked for this purpose. In more extensive interdisciplinary research projects and collaborations, the insights and partial results gained through communication and evaluation from different perspectives are of particular importance. This facilitates the publication of research data and partial results, which consequently develop a stronger dynamic and relevance for the overall research process.
