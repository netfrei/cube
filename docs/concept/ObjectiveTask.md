# The consortium’s main objectives and task areas

Digital transformation is fundamentally changing the way researchers work, particularly those working in the small disciplines. These scholars are typically involved in highly collaborative and global long-term projects which use innovative technology, but they often lack the research data and publication infrastructure normally provided by their home institutions. Collaborative projects require agile workflows for all user groups. Data aggregation, preparation, processing, analyses and publications are elements of modern scholarly research. The aim of the NFDI4SD consortium is to provide scholars with research-integrating data along with other scientific activities. By concentrating on the small disciplines, the consortium will be able to provide researchers with the services that they require on a daily basis. The first objective will be to break up the traditional sequential research organization and weave research data, including the publication of the data, into an integrated research process, complemented by a moderated research model that weaves research data into the ongoing research workflow (the “cube”).

## Objectives

!!! Objective
    **O1**: Both the use and production of research data will be tightly integrated into ongoing research projects. From the beginning of science research has been an collaborative enterprise.  NFDI4SD services will become integral part of current research via an initial collaborative agreement between new research projects and the NFDI4SD. These agreements will be open to all disciplines, independent of their institutional classification as “small disciplines”.

Currently, the main desideratum of researchers working in the small disciplines is access to modern computational research data beyond the support of their home institutions and third-party funding bodies. As science is per se a collaborative undertaking, the open knowledge exchange is fundamental to innovative and critical science. As a supporting infrastructure, the NFDI4SD will be a novel institutional research partner in the scientific arena.

!!! Objective
    **O2**: The NFDI4SD will develop research data services that respond directly to the feedback of research projects. For many years now, the Arbeitsstelle Kleine Fächer has been recording the institutional settings of small disciplines. It enables direct communication between researchers, students, institutions and, in the future, the NFDI4SD.

Modern concepts of computational philosophy of science will guide the software architecture of computational research data flows.

!!! Objective
    **O3**: The NFDI4SD will use and supplement best-practice open source tools and computational libraries for services within the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC).

The NFDI4SD will be an active member of the German NFDI consortium and will strive to form collaborations with other suitable consortia. It will commit itself to the strategic plans of the EOSC Roadmap and seek membership in the newly created EOSC Association. The proven infrastructure of CERN’s Zenodo service will provide OpenAIRE data publication, data harvesting and the implementation of FAIR data principles to implement the eight ambitions of Open Science.

!!! Objective
    **O4**: The signing of agreements with relevant stakeholders – libraries, archives and other content providers – on standards, application programming interfaces (APIs) and open access via computer networks.

The NFDI4SD governing body will seek to make operational agreements with a number of content-providing institutions on the implementation and accessibility of APIs for the NFDI4SD’s infrastructure hub. These agreements, using widely accepted standards, will enable researchers to access large sets of research data from a large number of content-holding institutions. It is expected that, within a short space of time, the NFDI4SD will be able to provide standardized API and interface modules. The large variety of small disciplines involved will ensure that special collections beyond the major stakeholders will be included in this integrated network of content providers.

!!! Objective
    **O5**: The NFDI4SD aims to maximize the visibility of the impact of research

New generation metrics monitors will be implemented to monitor the use and impact of the NFDI4SD’s services as part of the consortium’s support of the research projects. Daily updated monitors and impact indicators will enable researchers to assess their collaborative global network as well as inform the NFDI4SD’s governing body of hotspots of usage and of the need to steer users towards a particular course of action.

!!! Objective
    **O6**: Publication and citizen science

All scientific output for general scholarly use will be regarded as published material. Such material goes beyond putting data on a file server: publications implement FAIR data principles and use review, curation and scholarly assessments. The NFDI4SD intends to establish new procedures and references for data publications in order to enhance to a significant degree the impact of research.


## Task areas

The nature, benefits and characteristics of research data are surprisingly complex: data exist in many different media formats and contribute to the information value of the subjects of research; and researchers benefit from the rapid exchange of their publications and research findings. A Research Management Plan will coordinate the use and interoperability of the NFDI4SD’s services. Internal and external forms of communicating for research purposes, data storage, usage and revision as well as full-page archiving, including the final publication of research results and research data, will all form part of the NFDI4SD’s services.

The workflow of research activities in the context of highly collaborative, agile scientific communities occurs at the interplay between data and theory, using – among other things – computational means. Such activities can neither be ordered as a linear sequence of tasks, nor as a research data life cycle. The organization of the workflow of research activities has been designed using Thomas Kuhn’s metaphor of science as a puzzle-solving activity. We describe the pipeline of scientific processes as the transformation of input data via research pipes into designed outcomes. This sequence of operation can be compared to the rotations of a multidimensional research cube (solving Rubik’s cube, for example). The cube’s faces represent the content, data, skills, or means of the research activities. Each single step (aka cube’s rotation leads to a new configuration).

This puzzle-solving metaphor facilitates the orchestration of the NFDI4SD’s services into research activities by organizing and communicating the growing repertoire of the NFDI4SD’s manifold of research data services. The cube describes the requirements, standards and quality of data, as well as their information, metadata and documentation, in order to assure the best usage of services. The NFDI4SD can confidently base its operation on a wide spectrum of standards, API norms, data formats as recommended by the European Open Science Cloud and other standard institutions. The NFDI4SD will rapidly develop a user-friendly service catalogue which will serve as a graphical user interface (GUI) for researchers, who will be able to choose their needed service, quickly apply it to their given data and research questions and obtain their intended results.

!!! Task_area
    **TA1**: research fields

The aim of this large task area is to observe at close range the application of the NFDI4SD’s services and then to recommend the development of additional services to satisfy the demands from the various disciplines. TA1 will be supported by a broad range of fields, assisted by coordinators.

!!! Task_area
    **TA2**: services, machine learning, big data and data connectivity

The operational task area develops and secures the operation of the NFDI4SD’s infrastructure. Using ZENODO utilizes Europe’s largest and renowned research data publication platform and its comprehensive computer power.

!!! Task_area
    **TA3**: collaboration tools, user interfaces and publications

Today’s research environments are leading to a rising demand for cloud collaboration services. Direct exchange is being replaced by the publication of texts and data. User interfaces ensure that scholars and scientists can effectively use and control data without any special training. In addition, metadata as well as knowledge graphs, advanced catalogues and reference tools will enable users of the NFDI4SD’s services to make the most of open scientific data.

!!! Task_area
    **TA4**: standards, metadata and quality assessment

Data encoding, flow computers, computer interfaces, APIs and publications require the widest applicable standards, norms and metadata. Our principal investigators (PIs) are long-term members of the key standardization committees and so will ensure the interoperability of the research data over a long period of time.

!!! Task_area
    **TA5**: institutions, governance, public outreach, media and literacy

The highly experienced and international scientific representatives responsible for this TA will ensure optimal information flow and the smooth undertaking of negotiations and agreements with research institutions worldwide. The organization of virtual conferences, newsletters, blogs, and hopefully of physical meetings in the future, should ensure productive and effective scientific communication and present the research results to the general public.

!!! Task_area
    **TA6**: legal aspects

Intense scientific collaborative work and the exchange of information, including the production of publications, involve complex legal considerations. This area will be tasked with preparing the operating rules, information desks and consultation services. It will also actively shape the future legal landscape of the research activities of the digital transformation that we are currently undergoing.
