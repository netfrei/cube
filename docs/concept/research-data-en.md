# **Research Data**

## Epistemology of research data

Since the very beginning, research data have been published and used as a separate genre of knowledge in the history of academia. They are therefore not an invention of the digital age. Data catalogs such as Ptolemy's Geography ordered the places and paths of the ancient world, and with the help of his Handy Tables, scholars determined the constellation of the stars. Calendars and associated religious feasts were also based on research data, and encyclopedias standardized not least the understanding and communication of knowledge. Extensive collections of research data created the success of modern scholarship, and modern science, in close interaction with the development of grand theories–but as collaborative joint works, they often did not bear an author's name. Research data is epistemically verified with the greatest care in all academic cultures. They are knowledge assets that are regularly examined to identify errors as quickly as possible and to mark validated data. Thus, research data is not simply information that is disseminated on the Internet in the digital age, linked to other data and openly accessible without regard to its truthfulness. Nor is it "closed data", which like an esoteric treasure is only accessible on the basis of privileges.

The concept of knowledge was introduced by academia to characterize this special status of information about society and the world. With the generic nature of theory, we can characterize research data as the descriptions of any class of objects that qualify as knowledge or that are pending examination for this status. Research data as knowledge about the properties of research objects with all methodological evaluations by the academic community are distinguished from arbitrary information: Research data are collaboratively, openly and critically examined; they represent a claim of validity that can be revised at any time. The organization of scholarly communication and the ethos in dealing with knowledge is optimized to minimize errors. The established methodological mechanisms should also apply to research data in all disciplines.

For the NFDI4SD, this special status of research data in the concert of all academic disciplines - also and especially the so-called small disciplines - is the main focus for the tasks of a future research data infrastructure.

  **RD1**: With Research data scholars and scientists claim fallible knowledge. Research data can be justified and serve as justifying grounds. Research data are open to epistemic qualification. To this end, they must be computationally identified in all times independent of their symbolic form. All epistemic qualification are transparent to the community.

With the term "epistemic qualification", all additional attributes can be summarized, which are relevant for a distinction and treatment of research data as knowledge. Research data can be distinguished according to the components of the content of the data, its metadata and the epistemic qualification. The content of research data refers to the characteristics of the research objects described by the data. Research data always include both: their content and the additional attributes. Accordingly, an infrastructure of research data must take into account and carefully maintain its integrity.

In this context an analogy to the Paratext debate [@zotero-40395] of the last years can be drawn: Based on the philological concept introduced by Gérard Genette (1930-2018), paratexts (divided into peri- and epitext) are described as those elements added to an (originally literary) basic text which decisively influence and control the reception and distribution of a work. Such elements include information on the author, publisher, title, preface, thanks, etc. [@genette1997] This concept, which draws greater attention to production processes and authorization instances, was successively expanded in further research to include text genres and formats of new media. In the context of the digitization of research data, this means that the verification, authorization and sustainable presentation of research data in particular will have a decisive influence on the maintenance and further development of national and international standards and quality requirements.

​    **RD2**: Research-data are a composit of data-content, metadata and epistemic attributes. It unifies all those information about data-sources like texts including their paratexts. Their composition will adhere epistemic principles enhancing the requirements of obtaining, accessing and maintaining scientific knowledge.

As of the 1920s, the physicist and philosopher Hans Reichenbach distinguished the context of discovery from the context of justification for the critical evaluation of statements. The context of discovery takes into account causes that lead to a new insight and assessment of scientific facts. The reasons for the justification of statements must be separated from this - regardless of whether they are theoretical hypotheses or the content of research data. From the perspective of the researchers who are searching for new answers and who create and use research data for this purpose, the focus is on the discovery context. In doing so, they overlook the fact that even a discovery process is always based on knowledge that has already been justified. Research data are validated particularly carefully if they are versioned for publication during the research process.

​    **RD3**: The value of research data must always be assessed from the perspective of further use by others, and not from the perspective of the first person in the discovery process.

The justification of knowledge - and thus the validity of research data - is always a collaborative task of the entire research community. Therefore, the research data infrastructure must provide the means to trace the provenance of research data and epistemic dependence on third parties. This is rarely guaranteed at present.

​    **RD4:** The justification of the data by other research data should be as transparent and comprehensible as possible. A "dependency graph" can show the relation of the research data to other research data and thus clarify the epistemic dependencies among each other. It should be recognizable on which academic assumptions the validity of research data depends.

Within an innovative research organization, it follows that newly acquired data must be made available to other academics as quickly and completely as possible with regard to their epistemic qualification. This act of transferring research data from the hands of the individual researchers working in the discovery context to the public deserves its own, special term: the academic publication.

​    **RD5: **Publication. Publishing of research data is the act of handing over to the academic community compiled findings of data in the discovery context. Only then do results become justifiable knowledge. The status of research data is given to empirical findings only through publication. Research data publication leads to citable data sets, which are listed in a bibliography by other authors like current research literature.

The latter principle consequently leads to the publication of research data being considered in the management plan as early as possible. A strict sequence of processes, in which the publication of research data is planned only after the completion of one project after all other completed activities, is thus not reasonable from the point of view of academic theory and is detrimental to an innovative research. The data publication and the innovative data citation will lead to research projects gaining a high level of visibility and the own data publication will significantly increase the impact of the project and the people involved in it.

  **RD6:** Citing research data. Use of research data for other data or in textual publication should cite the origin. Citing research data should be listed in bibliographies or lists of references like any other scholarly source. Its publication format resembles the reference styles like any other bibliographical source. Citations can be managed and administered in citation databases or tools.

During the course of research projects, many research data are created in relation to other data. The new data are annotated, linked or otherwise needed for further research. The scope of these research data is huge, yet they are currently only published to a small extent. These data sets considerably increase the usefulness of the data associated with them.

​    **RD7:** Enhancing research data. Modern research projects create rich additional research data during the research process.



## **Institutional consequences: FAIR use**

We understand the FAIR principles as requirements for an infrastructure that has to serve the status of research data as a knowledge base for a collaborative, open science.

In order to create these conditions, international research associations and institutions committed themselves to the implementation of the FAIR principles. Increasingly, funding institutions link the allocation of funds to fulfilled FAIR conditions. Today, however, these conditions cannot be guaranteed by researchers alone: Especially agile research projects in small disciplines do not have the resources to meet the special requirements of providing and using research data. This will in future depend on a research-based infrastructure.

From the many implementations of the FAIR principles we follow the proposals of the GO FAIR initiative. (gofair) This initiative formulates its vision as follows: "Fostering the coherent development of the global Internet of FAIR Data & Services (IFDS), with the main focus on early developments in the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC).

## Findable

>The first step in (re)using data is to find them. Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. Machine-readable metadata are essential for automatic discovery of datasets and services, so this is an essential component of the FAIRification process.

>F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier

>F2. Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below)

>F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe

>F4. (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource


## Accessible

>Once the user finds the required data, she/he needs to know how can they be accessed, possibly including authentication and authorisation.

>A1. (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol

>A1.1 The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable

>A1.2 The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure, where necessary

>A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available

## Interoperable

>The data usually need to be integrated with other data. In addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing.

>I1. (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation

>I2. (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles

>I3. (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data

## Reusable

>The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimise the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings.

>R1. (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes

>R1.1. (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license

>R1.2. (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance

>R1.3. (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards



Many of the principles mentioned above allow for a wide scope of interpretation. Accordingly, no technical specifications can be derived from these regulations. Expressions for the release of and access to data such as "released" and "accessible" are underspecified with regard to the procedures. NFDI4SD's partner ZENODO from CERN developed its own "best effort principles". (s) A substantial part of the data publication of small and medium sized research data collections is expected to be done on the Zenodo platform. Extensive collections will be stored in separate data repositories. They are to realize Zenodo's implementation proposals in the context of preliminary approximations.

[s]: The goal of an Open Access infrastructure is prominently formulated in the plan-s and has been put on the agenda of many European organizations of academic institutions. The results of a self-assessment with regard to these objectives are to be published on a regular basis together with the metrics of research data use that have been determined.
