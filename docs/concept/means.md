# Work program

## Terminology

DFG proposed using the following terminology, services and work programme:

> **Services:** In describing the services to be provided by the consortium, distinguish clearly between services that consortium members will provide as part of their institutional mission (Grundaufgaben) based on existing funding, and new services that will be established within the NFDI framework (and for which funding can be requested within the NFDI).

> **Work Program:** This section describes the structure of your work programme as it relates to the specific **aims** and **objectives** of the proposed consortium, particularly to your research data management strategy. Major achievements to be attained during the course of the work programme, such as community-wide standards, can be defined as **milestones.** Tangible results, such as defined services, can be categorised as **deliverables.**

> The work programme of a consortium is divided into **task areas**, which may consist of different **measures.** Please provide **tabular overviews** of the envisaged task areas, the proposed **measures per task area**, and the **individual(s) responsible for a given task area (co- spokespersons)**. Provide a detailed description of the measures to be addressed in the task area and explain how they relate to your specific objectives. Explain the contribution of the consortium members and/or participants who will be involved in the individual measures.

> **Mark task areas that are relevant to other NFDI consortia** or will be applied for within other consortia accordingly and explain the relation (e.g. by using footnotes or text below the table).

> The coordination and **administrative tasks for the consortium as a whole** must be included in a separate task area –usually the concluding one. Note that applicants may request funds to coordinate activities or work with other consortia.



#**Table 5.0: Overview of task areas**

In the following sections (5.1, 5.2, etc.), please provide a detailed description of the task areas using the template provided below and repeat this format in accordance with the number of task areas in your work programme. Name the task area in the heading and add additional items as required. The coordination and administrative tasks for the consortium as a whole must be included in a separate task area –usually the concluding one. Note that applicants may request funds to coordinate activities or work with other consortia.

5.1 [Task Area 1]

Provide a detailed description of the measures to be addressed in the task area and explain how they relate to your specific objectives. It may be helpful to work with or develop use cases to illustrate your approach. Which aspects of your research data management strategy will be addressed by this task area? Explain the contribution of the consortium members and/or participants who will be involved in the individual measures. How will this task area cooperate with other task areas (include cross-area dependencies where applicable)? Address possible risks of implementation.
