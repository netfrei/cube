  abstract = {Paratexts are those liminal devices and conventions, both within and outside the book, that form part of the complex mediation between book, author, publisher and reader: titles, forewords, epigraphs and publishers' jacket copy are part of a book's private and public history. In this first English translation of Paratexts, G\'erard Genette shows how the special pragmatic status of paratextual declaration requires a carefully calibrated analysis of their illocutionary force. With clarity, precision and an extraordinary range of reference, Paratexts constitutes an encyclopedic survey of the customs and institutions as revealed in the borderlands of the text. Genette presents a global view of these liminal mediations and the logic of their relation to the reading public by studying each element as a literary function. Richard Macksey's foreword describes how the poetics of paratexts interact with more general questions of literature as a cultural institution, and situates Gennet's work in contemporary literary theory.},

  abstract = {One would have thought we're probably not that far away from completing the Catalogue of Life, this vast encyclopedia of all animal and plant species, right? Not even close! Even though bio-taxonomists have tried for centuries to systematically document life, they couldn't even imagine the complications these dark ages of digital information brought to their noble cause. Apparently, chameleons, spiders, and big cats don't only hide in nature, but also behind pay-walled publications and badly scanned 18th-century manuscripts. Millions of figures, taxonomic descriptions, and collected materials end up lost, destroyed, and undiscoverable to the research community. This is a story of how Plazi, a non-profit association for bio-taxonomic literature, took up the task to liberate life from these PDF cages, give it a FAIR chance, and with the help of Zenodo put a PID on it and provide a safe and sustainable home. It is also a story on how, similar to wildlife, even data can disguise itself inside papers but eventually using the power of PIDs join the tree of life and make it bloom. We'll explore what these fantastic PIDs look like, and how we make it possible for anybody to find them even in the darkest corners of tropical rainforests and harsh deserts.},

Modern graphs, particularly in industrial applications, contain billions of nodes and trillions of edges, which exceeds the capability of existing embedding systems. We present PyTorch-BigGraph (PBG), an embedding system that incorporates several modifications to traditional multi-relation embedding systems that allow it to scale to graphs with billions of nodes and trillions of edges. PBG uses graph partitioning to train arbitrarily large embeddings on either a single machine or in a distributed environment. We demonstrate comparable performance with existing embedding systems on common benchmarks, while allowing for scaling to arbitrarily large graphs and parallelization on multiple machines. We train and evaluate embeddings on several large social network graphs as well as the full Freebase dataset, which contains over 100 million nodes and 2 billion edges.},

The creation and maintenance of such vocabularies is, however, time-consuming and expensive. The diversity of research questions in the humanities makes it virtually impossible to create shared controlled vocabularies that cover a wide range of potential applications and satisfy the needs of diverse stakeholders. In this paper we present a novel conceptual approach for mitigating these problems. We propose that projects define their own vocabularies as needed and link the vocabulary terms to one or more concepts in a reference thesaurus, so that the project-specific term effectively serves as a "label" for a set of shared concepts. We also describe the implementation of this approach in the Labeling System. The Labeling System is a Web application that allows users to easily import concepts or create SKOS vocabularies and link the vocabulary terms to concepts from one or more reference thesauri.},

  abstract = {Data in the life sciences are extremely diverse and are stored in a broad spectrum of repositories ranging from those designed for particular data types (such as KEGG for pathway data or UniProt for protein data) to those that are general-purpose (such as FigShare, Zenodo, Dataverse or EUDAT). These data have widely different levels of sensitivity and security considerations. For example, clinical observations about genetic mutations in patients are highly sensitive, while observations of species diversity are generally not. The lack of uniformity in data models from one repository to another, and in the richness and availability of metadata descriptions, makes integration and analysis of these data a manual, time-consuming task with no scalability. Here we explore a set of resource-oriented Web design patterns for data discovery, accessibility, transformation, and integration that can be implemented by any general- or special-purpose repository as a means to assist users in finding and reusing their data holdings. We show that by using off-the-shelf technologies, interoperability can be achieved atthe level of an individual spreadsheet cell. We note that the behaviours of this architecture compare favourably to the desiderata defined by the FAIR Data Principles, and can therefore represent an exemplar implementation of those principles. The proposed interoperability design patterns may be used to improve discovery and integration of both new and legacy data, maximizing the utility of all scholarly outputs.},
