Thomas Kuhn created the metaphor of research as puzzle solving. Rubik's cube is a paradigm for puzzle solving. Workflows With research data as synthesis of content and its paratext are best narrated by puzzling with "cubes" instead of "research data lifecycles". Aspects of research data like their metadata, provenience, or linked data, are panels of the cube's sides. Rotations of the cube's arrangements of planes describe activities or NFDI4SD services with data. The ultimate goal is the publication of research data: when all panels on one side match, research data are open to the community for reuse.
